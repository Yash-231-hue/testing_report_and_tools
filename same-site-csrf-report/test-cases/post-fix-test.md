# Test Cases â€“ After Fix

## Objective
Validate that CSRF fix prevents unauthorized email change.

## Steps
1. Log in with a test account.
2. Use the same external page/form.
3. Attempt to submit a request to change email without a CSRF token.

## Expected
The request should be rejected with 403 Forbidden or similar error.

## Actual (After Fix)
The application now correctly blocks the request without a valid CSRF token.

## Additional Checks
- Method override parameters are ignored
- SameSite=Strict is set on session cookies
- Server validates Origin/Referer headers
